# 🌐 Physical AI: Detailed Overview

Physical AI combines **artificial intelligence** with **physical devices** to create systems that can **see, sense, move, and interact** with the real world. Unlike traditional AI, which exists only in software, Physical AI has a **body**, **sensors**, and **actuators** that allow it to perform **real-world tasks**.

## 🏗️ Core Components of Physical AI

| Component | Icon | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Sensors** | 🎯 | Devices that detect environment changes, e.g., cameras, LIDAR, touch sensors. |
| **Actuators** | ⚙️ | Motors and mechanisms that allow movement and interaction with objects. |
| **Controllers** | 🧠 | AI algorithms and software that process sensor data and control actuators. |
| **Communication** | 📡 | Enables robots to exchange information with other devices or humans. |

## 🔍 How Physical AI Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Perception** 👁️  
   - Sensors collect data from the environment.  
   - Example: A robot detects a cup on the table.  

2. **Decision Making** 🧠  
   - AI processes sensor data and plans actions.  
   - Example: Robot decides to pick up the cup.  

3. **Action/Execution** ✋  
   - Actuators perform the planned action.  
   - Example: Robot moves its arm and picks the cup smoothly.
