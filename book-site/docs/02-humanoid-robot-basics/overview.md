## 🏗️ Anatomy of a Humanoid Robot

| Part | Icon | Function |
|------|------|---------|
| **Head/Face** | 🧠 | Houses cameras, microphones, and AI for perception and communication. |
| **Torso** | 🫀 | Contains central processing unit (CPU) and battery. |
| **Arms & Hands** | ✋ | Perform tasks like picking, holding, and manipulating objects. |
| **Legs & Feet** | 🦵 | Provide mobility and balance for walking or running. |
| **Sensors** | 🎯 | Cameras, touch sensors, gyroscopes for balance and perception. |
| **Actuators** | ⚙️ | Motors controlling movement of joints. |

## 🔄 How Humanoid Robots Move

**1. Perception** 👁️  
- Sensors detect obstacles, objects, and human gestures.  

**2. Planning** 🧠  
- AI algorithms calculate balance, movement, and action sequences.  

**3. Execution** ✋🦵  
- Actuators move joints to perform the desired action.  

> Example: Robot waves its hand to greet a person.
