# 🤖 AI Planning for Humanoid Robots

**AI Planning** allows robots to **decide a sequence of actions** to achieve goals efficiently. It’s like giving a humanoid robot a **“to-do list”** in the real world.

## 🧩 Key Concepts

| Concept | Icon | Description |
|---------|------|------------|
| **Goal** | 🎯 | The final task the robot wants to achieve (e.g., pick up an object). |
| **State** | 📌 | The current configuration of the robot & environment. |
| **Action** | ⚡ | Operation that changes the state (e.g., move arm, walk). |
| **Plan** | 🗺️ | Sequence of actions to reach the goal from the current state. |
| **Planner** | 🤖 | AI algorithm that generates the plan (e.g., A*, RRT, PDDL-based planners). |

## 🧠 Planning Example: Grid Navigation

- Robot starts at **A**, goal is **B**.  
- Possible actions: move up, down, left, right.  
- Planner finds **shortest or safest path**.
